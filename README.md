# SimpleAngularDndApp

Welcome to this humble portfolio project! This Angular app retrieves data from https://api.open5e.com/ and is meant to demonstrate a simple single-page application.

It displays DnD 5e race and class information in sortable + filterable Angular Material tables, which can be clicked to view a detailed view. 
The ngx-toastr library is used to display messages to the user - otherwise, the project only relies on Angular and Angular Material packages. 

All images came from www.dndbeyond.com.

Please feel free to view the application in StackBlitz: https://stackblitz.com/github/OxBellows/simple-angular-dnd-app.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
